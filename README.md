# Machine-Learning-Portfolio

This portfolio is being developed by Gabriel Estivalet to use Machine Learning techniques on regression and classification problems. The files that start with `Udacity` are projects developed following course content from the School.


### The sources used as guidelines for these projects are:

- General Assembly: Data Science course materials;

- Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree materials;

- Muller & Guido: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python, O'Reilly, 2016;

- Wes McKinney: Python for Data Analysis, O'Reilly, 2013;

- Allen B. Downey: Think Stats, O'Reilly, 2015.
